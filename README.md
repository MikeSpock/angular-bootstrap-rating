========================
 **Rating With Stars Input - A Lightweight Angular Directive Based on Bootstrap**

This is a really easy and straight-forward directive to work with in Angular.
All it does is give you a star rating functionality.

####Dependencies:
- Angular
- Bootstrap (actually, the only thing I use is glyphicons from bootstrap, so its easy to modifiy for other needs)

####Usage:
Here we go

```<span reevio-rating="3" reevio-rating-length="5"></span>```
The source is so small, its incredible, three cheers for Angular :)

You can use it dynamically too:
```<span reevio-rating="myAngularVariable" reevio-rating-length="5"></span>```
